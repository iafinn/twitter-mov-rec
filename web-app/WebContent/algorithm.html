<h2>Algorithm: User-Based Collaborative Filtering</h2> 
<h3>Overview</h3>

Movie recommendations are generated for a user based on their similarity to people who have rated movies on Twitter (i.e. other users).
Since many users are 'collaborating' to recommend a movie, this approach is called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering" class="link">user-based collaborative filtering</a>. More specifically,
the app uses the user-based nearest neighbor algorithm. Let's consider the steps in the algorithm to see why it's a 
'nearest neighbor' collaborative filter.

<br>
<br>
In order to find a list of recommended movies, the algorithm goes through the following steps:
<ol>
<li> Calculate the similarity between the user and each person from Twitter by comparing their reviews. Details for
this step are given in the next section.</li>
<li> Identify the k most similar people from Twitter (k nearest neighbors) based on their similarity with the user. 
In this app I've chosen k=500. </li>
<li> Select movies that have been rated by at least j of the nearest neighbor people from Twitter. 
This app uses j=5. </li>

<li> Calculate a weighted average rating for the selected movies using the similarity score for the weights. </li>

<li> Sort the movie list in descending order by the weighted average rating and suggest the top 10 movies. </li>
</ol>


This method assumes that users who share similar movie preferences will be the best people for recommending new movies to watch. 
On the other hand, users with dissimilar movie tastes would make poor recommendations to one another. If these assumptions
aren't true, the algorithm will not make good recommendations. Another weakness of this approach is that it can perform poorly 
on sparse datasets -- those that have few ratings per user. While the Twitter dataset is relatively sparse, there are still 13009 
users with 10 or more ratings and 1619 users with 100 or more ratings. This provides a sufficient number of users to make recommendations 
for most queries.

<h3>Calculating the Similarity</h3>

The similarity is a key component in this algorithm. To compute the similarity, the users are represented in vector form. 
Each entry in the user vectors is the rating of that user on that movie. The vector (5,1), for example, would represent 5/10 
for the first movie in the dataset and 1/10 for the second movie. I center the ratings vectors to the mean rating for a movie
for all users in the data set, so that differences from the mean rating are more clearly highlighted. In this case, if the average 
ratings for the first two movies were 6 and 7, this user would have a rating vector (-1,-6). 

The similarity between two users a and b is given by a modified cosine similarity:
<br>
<br>
<img src="resources/cosinesim.png" class="equation">
<br>
<br>
Here, the second part of the equation is close to the vector definition of the cosine  -- dot product of the vectors divided by 
their magnitudes. I have added an extra 1 in the denominator so that the equation is numerically stable for users that are close
to the mean ratings. I could have added a smaller value, say .001, for this purpose, but I also don't want to give users that are near
to the mean too large of a similarity boost. The prime symbols indicate that the coordinate system has been centered at the mean 
rating for each movie. 
<br>
<br>
The third part of the equation is the computation of the cosine in terms of ratings r. The r_a,i is the rating of rater a for 
movie i, and the sum in the numerator is over the set of movies that have been rated by both raters. Again, the denominator normalizes 
to the length of the vectors + 1 for numerical stability. By centering the vectors around the mean, the missing entries
are implicity included as the mean value for each movie. Without centering, missing movies would be implicity included as 0/10. 

Graphically, we can visualize the similarities between two users on two movies in a 2D coordinate space:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

If the user rating vectors are perpendicular, they will have a similarity of 0. An acute angle leads to a
 positive similarity and an obtuse angle leads to a negative similarity. Qualitatively, the similarity tells
 us if the ratings vectors are closer to pointing parallel (positive) or anti-parallel (negative) in the 
 rating space.
<br>
<br>
It's worth noting that this modified cosine similarity is close to the definition of the commonly used Pearson correlation similarity.
 In the Pearson correlation the mean value for a user, rather than for all users, is used. This is a good approach for data
 where there are users that tend to rate all items negatively or all items positively. This doesn't seem to be a serious 
 problem in this data set. Examining the distribution of reviews (see Github) the data set has a median rating of 8 with an 
 IQR of 2 points. Thus, it seems that most raters give fairly positive reviews without a very broad distribution. Pearson correlation
 also suffers from the 'cold start' problem, as it takes many reviews for a user to get an accurate mean review. The modified
 cosine similarity does better, since the average is always computed over all raters. 

<h3>The Data</h3>

The recomendation algorithm uses a dataset of ratings from Twitter compiled 
by <a href="https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings" class='link'>MovieTweetings</a>. The 
dataset consists of movie titles, their IMDB IDs, user IDs, and user ratings. I
cleaned the dataset to remove duplicates and to get a set of unique titles and
genres. Details are given on the Github page.
